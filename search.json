    "text": "Identifying and Managing Outliers in Farm Area and Perimeter Data for Enhanced Analysis\nThis strategy focuses on systematically identifying and handling outliers in farm area and perimeter data based on country and location type. By calculating and applying well-defined limits, we ensure the dataset’s integrity and reliability for producing meaningful insights and visualizations.\n\n\nRationale\nOutliers in area and perimeter data can arise from various sources, such as:\n\nErrors in data collection or entry.\nNatural variations in farm sizes across regions and location types.\nInclusion of atypical farms or locations, such as ceremonial areas or natural reserves.\n\nThese anomalies can distort trends, making it critical to identify and manage them. Our approach involved calculating precise bounds tailored to each country and location type, allowing for better handling of variability.\n\n\n\nImplementation Strategy\n\nData Sources\nKey columns from the dataset:\n\ncountry_name: The country where the farm is located.\ntype: The type of location (e.g., field, greenhouse, natural_area).\ntotal_area_ha: The total area of the location in hectares.\ntotal_perimeter_m: The total perimeter of the location in meters.\n\n\n\n\n\nSteps\n\n1. Calculate Descriptive Statistics\nWe began by analyzing the minimum, maximum, and mean values for both area and perimeter by location type across all countries. For example:\n\nFields in Brazil:\n\nMin Area: 0 ha\nMax Area: 4,247,578 ha\nMean Area: 422.44 ha\nMin Perimeter: 0 m\nMax Perimeter: 900,000 m\nMean Perimeter: 665.21 m\n\nGreenhouses in Canada:\n\nMin Area: 0.000013 ha\nMax Area: 719.07 ha\nMean Area: 1.16 ha\nMin Perimeter: 4 m\nMax Perimeter: 13,288 m\nMean Perimeter: 132.79 m\n\n\n\n\n2. Percentile-Based Thresholds\nFor each location type within a country, we calculated the 5th percentile (lower cap) and 95th percentile (upper cap) for total_area_ha and total_perimeter_m. This helped filter out extreme values at both ends of the spectrum. For instance:\n\nFields in Japan:\n\nLower Cap (Area): 0.0017 ha\nUpper Cap (Area): 2.08 ha\nLower Cap (Perimeter): 14 m\nUpper Cap (Perimeter): 947 m\n\nGreenhouses in Brazil:\n\nLower Cap (Area): 0.001 ha\nUpper Cap (Area): 0.1011 ha\nLower Cap (Perimeter): 14.55 m\nUpper Cap (Perimeter): 206 m\n\n\n\n\n3. Interquartile Range (IQR) Analysis\nTo refine our thresholds, we used the IQR method:\n\nIQR Formula: IQR=Q3−Q1\n\nLower Bound: Q1−1.5×IQR (set to 0 if negative).\nUpper Bound: Q3+1.5×IQR.\n\n\nFor example:\n\nFarm Site Boundaries in Colombia:\n\nIQR Area: 0 to 19.13 ha\nIQR Perimeter: 106 to 2,998 m.\n\nResidences in the U.S.:\n\nIQR Area: 0 to 0.075 ha\nIQR Perimeter: 27 to 144 m.\n\n\n\n\n4. Merging and Combining Thresholds\nWe combined percentile-based and IQR-based thresholds to define the final limits:\n\nLower Limit: Maximum of the 5th percentile and the IQR lower bound.\nUpper Limit: Minimum of the 95th percentile, maximum value, and the IQR upper bound.\n\nFor instance:\n\nBarns in Canada:\n\nLower Area Limit: 0.0014 ha\nUpper Area Limit: 0.055 ha\nLower Perimeter Limit: 16 m\nUpper Perimeter Limit: 125.5 m.\n\n\n\n\n\n5. Filtering Valid and Outlier Data\nUsing the calculated limits, we filtered the dataset into:\n\nValid Data: Farms with areas and perimeters within the defined bounds.\nOutliers: Farms falling outside these bounds.\n\nFor example:\n\nValid Farms in Colombia:\n\nFarm Site Boundaries with area between 0.0471 ha and 19.13 ha, and perimeter between 106 m and 2,998 m.\n\nOutlier Farms in Japan:\n\nFields with area below 0.0017 ha or above 2.08 ha, or perimeter outside the range of 14 m to 947 m.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nConclusion\nThis approach systematically identified and managed outliers in farm area and perimeter data, balancing statistical methods (percentiles, IQR) with practical domain considerations. By merging multiple thresholds, we ensured robust and actionable results, enabling accurate analysis of agricultural patterns across diverse countries and location types."

    "text": "This methodology was implemented to classify farms as being located on land or in the ocean based on their geographic coordinates. This classification aimed to improve the accuracy and reliability of spatial analyses by identifying potential outliers (e.g., farms with invalid locations).\n\n\n\nIn the LiteFarm database, some farms have geographic coordinates that place them in unexpected locations, such as oceans or water bodies. While some of these farms are valid (e.g., located on small islands or near coastal boundaries), others may be due to data entry errors or inaccuracies in the mapping process. By identifying and classifying such farms, we aim to:\n\nEnsure data reliability for spatial and environmental analyses.\nExclude invalid farms to avoid skewed results.\nHighlight farms near coastlines or on small islands as potential outliers for manual review.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe farm data was extracted from the LiteFarm database using an SQL query.\nFilters were applied to exclude test farms and known “fake” farms, ensuring only genuine records were analyzed.\nKey attributes included:\n\nfarm_id: Unique identifier for each farm.\nfarm_name: Name of the farm.\ncountry_name: Country where the farm is located.\ngrid_points: Latitude and longitude coordinates representing the farm’s location.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Natural Earth 10m Land Dataset (ne_10m_land.shp) was used for high-resolution land boundary data.\nUsing the geopandas library, the following steps were performed:\n\nPoint-in-Polygon Check: Each farm’s grid_points were converted into geographic points.

    "text": "In the process of validating farm data, it’s crucial to ensure that the dataset contains only genuine entries. A lot of the times, farmers and new users, make demo farms when testing the app. Invalid or placeholder farm names can skew analyses and lead to inaccurate conclusions. One effective strategy to enhance data quality is filtering out farms with names that are likely placeholders or test entries.\n\n\nDuring data collection, especially in systems undergoing testing or user onboarding, it’s common to encounter farm names that are not real. These may include default names, test entries, or placeholders like “Test Farm,” “Demo,” or “ABC.” Including such entries in data analyses can distort results and insights.\n\n\n\nTo remove farms with invalid names, We utilize the following SQL query. This query filters out entries where the farm_name contains any of the specified substrings indicative of a test or placeholder name.\nWHERE LOWER(f.farm_name) LIKE '%fake%'\n   OR LOWER(f.farm_name) LIKE '%prueba%'\n   OR LOWER(f.farm_name) LIKE '%test%'\n   OR LOWER(f.farm_name) LIKE '%abc%'\n   OR LOWER(f.farm_name) LIKE '%123%'\n   OR LOWER(f.farm_name) LIKE '%hola%'\n   OR LOWER(f.farm_name) LIKE '%sample%'\n   OR LOWER(f.farm_name) LIKE '%demo%'\n   OR LOWER(f.farm_name) LIKE '%delete%'\n   OR LOWER(f.farm_name) LIKE '%none%'\n   OR LOWER(f.farm_name) LIKE '%dummy%'\n   OR LOWER(f.farm_name) LIKE '%wrong%'\n   OR LOWER(f.farm_name) LIKE '%not real%'\n   OR LOWER(f.farm_name) LIKE '%litefarm%'\n   OR LOWER(f.farm_name) LIKE 'ab'\n   OR LOWER(f.farm_name) LIKE '%n/a%'\n\n\n\nfake, test, sample, demo, dummy, not real: Commonly used in testing environments to denote non-real entries.\nprueba: Spanish for “test,” capturing non-English placeholder names.\nabc, 123, ab: Generic placeholders often used when real data isn’t available.\nhola: Spanish for “hello,” possibly used as a default or test entry.\ndelete, none, n/a: Entries that may have been marked for deletion or indicate missing data.\nwrong: Indicates an incorrect or placeholder entry.\nLitefarm: Might be used as a default name within the system or during demonstrations.\n\nThe LOWER() function ensures the query is case-insensitive, capturing variations like “Test” and “test.”\n\n\n\n\n\nImproved Data Quality: Eliminates non-genuine entries, leading to more accurate analyses.\nEfficiency: Reduces the noise in the dataset, making data processing and analysis more efficient.\nReliability: Enhances the trustworthiness of insights derived from the data.\n\n\n\n\nWhile this strategy is effective, it’s important to be mindful of potential false positives.
